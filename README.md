## Hi there 👋

I am **Alessandro Piana** from Bergamo (Italy).

* 🎓 I completed an M.Sc. in **Mathematical Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano. My main interests are probability, statistics, machine learning, and decision-making under uncertainty
* 💼 Developed a master’s thesis on a **Digital Twin framework for ICU glucose management**
* 🌱 I am currently learning **generative AI frameworks** (e.g. *LangChain, LangGraph*) and **cloud-based tools on AWS**

I am currently working as a **Data Scientist** at [**Deix Srl**](./https://www.deix.ai/it)

## 🎓 M.Sc. Thesis

### *A Flexible Digital Twin Approach for ICU Glucose Management*

My master’s thesis focuses on the design of a **flexible, probabilistic Digital Twin framework** for glucose management in Intensive Care Units (ICU).

The proposed approach models the patient–digital twin interaction using **Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)**, with particular emphasis on:

* **Markov chains** to describe the stochastic evolution of the patient’s latent clinical state
* **Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs)** to jointly represent latent states, observations, clinical actions, and rewards over time
* **Probabilistic inference** techniques to estimate unobserved states and support decision-making under uncertainty

The framework is designed to be **modular, data-driven, and adaptable**, allowing the integration of heterogeneous clinical data (e.g. glucose measurements, insulin infusion rates) and enabling risk-aware decision support for ICU glucose control.
